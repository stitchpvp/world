To handle this, the StartDialogConversation function takes an extra parameter 'type'. Type 1 means you're passing a spawn in and type 2 means you're passing an item in.
         StartDialogConversation(Conversation, Type (1 or 2), (Spawn or Item), Player, text, mp3, key1, key2) where mp3, key1, and key2 are optional.

==10/13/2008:
LethalEncounter: Completed Step 1 of the item revamp.
			-Complete overhaul of item loading and storage.  Got rid of some obsolete fields and cleaned it up.  Items in the items table are now set with just two fields (bag_id and slot).  Bag_id is 0 for inventory items, otherwise it is the unique id of the bag which it is in.  Bag_id is -3 for bank, -4 for shared bank.
			-Simplification of the entire items lifecycle.  A lot of the code was way more complex than it needed to be, which led to some of the item issues.
			-Items will be added to bags first, then inventory if the bag is full (this includes starting_items).
			-Enhancements/overhaul of the starting_items table - you no longer have to specify the slot as it will automatically assign a slot in the given characters inventory.  It will now properly handle EQUIPPED items as well so you can automatically dress a character upon creation.
			-Support for banked/shared bank items added.  No need for the character_banks table.
			-Numerous bug fixes with the core item behavior.
			-Step 2 will be in a couple of weeks and will focus on the items themselves.
